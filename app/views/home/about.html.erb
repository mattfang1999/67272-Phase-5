    <h2><em>About the A &amp; M Creamery</em></h2>

    <p>
    	Back in the day when apples was just categorized as a fruit, and not a monopoly-making electronic device, or when Donald Trump was still sitting comfortably in Trump Towers and not the White House, there were two little boys, Alex and Mark.
    </p>

    <p>They had a dream.</p>

    <p>A dream so big, that would make even Martin Luther King Jr. gawk. A dream so big that would make Chick Filet open on a Sunday!</p>
    <p>This was a dream to open their very own creamery. They shed blood, sweat, and tears - worked long hours, but eventually made it big time by selling the best ice cream ever. You, my friend, are currently working under the most badass set of men ever to exist, after Jesus of course.</p>
